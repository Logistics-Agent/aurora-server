# Phase 17 — Shipment Import

## Status

Not Started

## Goal

Implement staff CSV or Excel import MVP.

## Prerequisites

Phase 16 completed.

## Read First

* `AGENTS.md`
* `codex/requirement.md`
* `codex/plan.md`
* `codex/specs/logistics-architecture.md`
* `codex/specs/shipment-workflow.md`

## Existing State

CreateShipment vertical slice is complete through Phase 10. Full Shipment Workflow MVP remains in progress.

## Scope

Implement row-level validation, import result reporting, small-file synchronous processing, clear large-file limit, tenant isolation, and idempotency where request identifier exists.

## Required Behavior

Small import creates shipments and cargo safely with useful per-row errors.

## Constraints

Do not introduce a complex background-import platform unless required.

## Validation Commands

```bash
dotnet build src/dotnet/ShipmentWorkflow/ShipmentWorkflow.csproj
dotnet test tests/dotnet/ShipmentWorkflow.Tests/ShipmentWorkflow.Tests.csproj
git diff --check
```

## Completion Criteria

* Scope is implemented or deliberately deferred with documented reason.
* Shipment Workflow builds successfully.
* Relevant tests pass.
* Tenant isolation is preserved.
* Task file and `codex/plan.md` are updated with command evidence.
* One local commit is created for this phase.
