# Phase 12 — Workflow State Machine

## Status

Not Started

## Goal

Implement complete shipment lifecycle transition validation.

## Prerequisites

Phase 11 completed.

## Read First

* `AGENTS.md`
* `codex/requirement.md`
* `codex/plan.md`
* `codex/specs/logistics-architecture.md`
* `codex/specs/shipment-workflow.md`

## Existing State

CreateShipment vertical slice is complete through Phase 10. Full Shipment Workflow MVP remains in progress.

## Scope

Add full statuses, allowed transitions, Submit, Planning, Negotiating, Confirmed, PickedUp, InTransit, CustomsProcessing, Delivered, Completed, Cancelled, domain events, and milestone creation from business transitions.

## Required Behavior

Clients cannot assign arbitrary states; every transition is validated and records the appropriate history/milestone/outbox intent.

## Constraints

Do not implement unrelated query/list/import features.

## Validation Commands

```bash
dotnet build src/dotnet/ShipmentWorkflow/ShipmentWorkflow.csproj
dotnet test tests/dotnet/ShipmentWorkflow.Tests/ShipmentWorkflow.Tests.csproj
git diff --check
```

## Completion Criteria

* Scope is implemented or deliberately deferred with documented reason.
* Shipment Workflow builds successfully.
* Relevant tests pass.
* Tenant isolation is preserved.
* Task file and `codex/plan.md` are updated with command evidence.
* One local commit is created for this phase.
