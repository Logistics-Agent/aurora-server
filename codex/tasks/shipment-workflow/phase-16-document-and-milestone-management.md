# Phase 16 — Document and Milestone Management

## Status

Not Started

## Goal

Implement shipment document metadata and business milestone behavior.

## Prerequisites

Phase 15 completed.

## Read First

* `AGENTS.md`
* `codex/requirement.md`
* `codex/plan.md`
* `codex/specs/logistics-architecture.md`
* `codex/specs/shipment-workflow.md`

## Existing State

CreateShipment vertical slice is complete through Phase 10. Full Shipment Workflow MVP remains in progress.

## Scope

Implement document metadata attachment, OCR status/confidence metadata, extracted JSON metadata, DocumentAttached event, business milestone recording, GPS/system/user sources, and timeline completion.

## Required Behavior

Shipment Workflow stores metadata and references only; files remain outside this service.

## Constraints

Do not implement OCR execution or object storage ownership unless explicitly assigned.

## Validation Commands

```bash
dotnet build src/dotnet/ShipmentWorkflow/ShipmentWorkflow.csproj
dotnet test tests/dotnet/ShipmentWorkflow.Tests/ShipmentWorkflow.Tests.csproj
git diff --check
```

## Completion Criteria

* Scope is implemented or deliberately deferred with documented reason.
* Shipment Workflow builds successfully.
* Relevant tests pass.
* Tenant isolation is preserved.
* Task file and `codex/plan.md` are updated with command evidence.
* One local commit is created for this phase.
